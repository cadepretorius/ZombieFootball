Zombie Football Game

I am 13 years old and I'm working on a game that's called "Zombie Football!" to help raise funds for a friend of mine that had brain surgery when he was younger.

It's really simple at the moment, (trying to keep it under 100 events) if you draw a line the player follows it.

Zombie football players (the opposing team) are running at you and the point of the game is to draw a path to avoid them and if necessary, kill them by throwing a football at them.

The proceeds go to Rady Children's hospital. If any of you guys could help out to make it a better game, it would be great! I'm kind of swamped at the moment & need help. :)

Maybe it would be cool if the football acted like a boomerang and came back to the player.

Adding a "Donate" button that links to www.brick-brainresearchincancerkids.org would also be great.

As I said before, any help would be greatly appreciated!

Regards,

Cade
